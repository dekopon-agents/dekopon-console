//! Observation decorators around the two seams a session already passes everything through.
//!
//! Nothing in `dekopon-agent` reports a tool call. The prompt loop returns counters, `History`
//! keeps only the prompt and the answer, and `shell.command` spans deliberately carry an argument
//! *count* rather than argument values. So the console does not read a feed — it wraps the two
//! traits the loop is built on and watches what goes through them:
//!
//! - [`RecordingRuntime`] wraps [`ScriptRuntime`], so it sees each model-authored script and its
//!   outcome, which is one model turn's worth of work.
//! - [`RecordingInvoker`] wraps [`CapabilityInvoker`], so it sees every capability the script
//!   dispatched, with the exact JSON in and the exact result out.
//!
//! Both forward every method unchanged and neither can influence a session: an observer that could
//! deny a call would be a second authorization path, and there is only ever one of those.
