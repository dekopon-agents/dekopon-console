//! Terminal console for driving Dekopon agents against a running local broker.
//!
//! The console is the gateway half of a development deployment, and nothing more privileged than
//! that. `dekopon-brokerd` holds the policy, the provider credentials, and the components; it has
//! no model client and no concept of a turn, so something has to run the loop. In production that
//! is `dekopond`, woken by a chat transport. Here it is this crate, woken by somebody typing.
//!
//! The local transcript records tool arguments/results for interactive inspection. Shared core
//! telemetry separately exports complete prompt/script/provider payloads under one turn trace
//! when configured, excluding model/provider credentials and telemetry authentication headers.
//!
//! It holds a model credential and nothing else. Every capability call is proposed to the broker on
//! behalf of an attested subject, and the broker alone decides it.
